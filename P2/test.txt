Arsenal, we're on your side
Our love we cannot hide
Our hearts are open wide
To cheer you along the way

We will be standing by
We know how hard you try
Whether you win or lose
It's you that we choose
So special when you surround

Now you have found
Supporters who
Will never let you down
We will be there
To cheer you on
By singing this song
Here is the song

Arsenal, we're on your side
Our love we cannot hide
Our hearts are open wide
For nobody else but you

Whether at home or away
We love to see you play
We'll be there on the day
The day they present
The honour that's meant for you

Arsenal, we're on your side
Our love we cannot hide
Our hearts are open wide
For nobody else but you

Arsenal, we're on your side
Our love we cannot hide
Our hearts are open wide
For nobody else but you
